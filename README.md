# gravity_sim
Gravity simulator in python

Customizable multi body simulator in python. Create as many bodies as you like and watch them interact!

This project is still work in progress, I still want to add a lot of fun things!

## How to run:
Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:KiandroDW/gravity_sim.git`
Install pygame: `pip install pygame`
run `main.py`: `python3 main.py`

## Controls:
`C` to set the current focus to the Center of mass.
`ESC` to close the program
`0` to return the focus to the original place.
`1-9` to select the nth body as focus if it exists. Else it leaves the focus on the last position.
